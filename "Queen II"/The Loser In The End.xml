          <l>Mama's gotta problem</l>
          <l>She don't know what to say</l>
          <l>Her little baby boy just left home today</l>
          <l>She's got to be the loser in the end</l>
          <l>She's got to be the loser in the end</l>
          <l>Misuse her and you'll lose her as a friend</l>
          <l>She's ma on whom you can always depend</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>She washed and fed, and clothed and cared</l>
          <l>For nearly twenty years</l>
          <l>And all she gets is &quot;goodbye ma&quot;</l>
          <l>And the nightimes for her tears</l>
          <l>She's got to be the loser in the end</l>
          <l>She's got to be the loser in the end</l>
          <l>Misuse her and you'll lose her as a friend</l>
          <l>She's ma on whom you can always depend</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>So listen mothers everywhere</l>
          <l>To just one mother's son</l>
          <l>You'll get forgotten on the way</l>
          <l>If you don't let them have their fun</l>
          <l>Forget regrets, and just remember</l>
          <l>It's so long since you were young</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>You're bound to be the loser in the end</l>
          <l>You're bound to be the loser in the end</l>
          <l>They'll choose their new shoes that's not far to bend</l>
          <l>You're ma on whom they can always depend</l>

      <head>Father To Son</head>
      <p>
        <l>A word in your ear, from father to son</l>
        <l>hear the words that I say</l>
        <l>I fought with you, fought on your side</l>
        <l>Long before you were born</l>
      </p>
      <p>
        <l>Joyful the sound, the word goes around</l>
        <l>From father to son, to son</l>
      </p>
      <p>
        <l>And the voice is so clear, time after time it leeps</l>
        <l>Calling you, calling you on</l>
        <l>Don't destroy what you see, your country to be</l>
        <l>Just keep on building on the ground that's been won</l>
      </p>
      <p>
        <l>Kings will be crowned, the word goes around</l>
        <l>From father to son, to son</l>
      </p>
      <p>
        <l>Take this letter that I give you,</l>
        <l>Take it sonny, hold it high</l>
        <l>You won't understand a word that's in it</l>
        <l>But you'll write it all again before you die</l>
        <l>A word in your ear from father to son</l>
        <l>Funny you don't hear a single word I say</l>
        <l>But my letter to you, will stay by your side</l>
        <l>Through the years till the loneliness is gone</l>
        <l>Sing if you will -</l>
        <l>But the air you breathe I live to give you</l>
      </p>
      <p>
        <l>Father to son</l>
        <l>Father to, father to, father to son</l>
      </p>
      <p>
        <l>Joyful the sound, the word goes around</l>
        <l>From father to son, to son...</l>
      </p>
      <p>
        <l>Kings will be crowned, the word goes around</l>
        <l>From father to son, to son...</l>

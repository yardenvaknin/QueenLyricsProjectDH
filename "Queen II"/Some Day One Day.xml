          <l>You never heard my song before the music was too loud</l>
          <l>But now i think you hear me well for now we both know how</l>
          <l>No star can light our way in this cloud of dark and fear</l>
          <l>But some day, one day...</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>Funny how the pages turn and hold us in between</l>
          <l>A misty castle waits for you and you shall be a queen</l>
          <l>Today the cloud it hangs over us and all is grey</l>
          <l>But some day, one day...</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>When i was you and you were me and we were very young</l>
          <l>Together took us nearly there the rest may not be sung</l>
          <l>So still the cloud it hangs over us and we're alone</l>
          <l>But some day, one day...</l>
          <l>We'll come home</l>

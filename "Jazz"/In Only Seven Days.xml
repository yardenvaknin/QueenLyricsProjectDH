          <l>Monday,</l>
          <l>Start of my holiday.</l>
          <l>Freedom for just one week.</l>
          <l>Feels good to get away.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>Tuesday,</l>
          <l>Saw her down on the beach.</l>
          <l>I stood and watched a while,</l>
          <l>And she looked and smiled at me.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>Wednesday,</l>
          <l>I didn't see her.</l>
          <l>I hoped that she'd be back tomorrow.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>And then on Thursday</l>
          <l>My luck had changed.</l>
          <l>She stood there all alone,</l>
          <l>I went and asked her name.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>I never thought that this could happen to me</l>
          <l>In only seven days.</l>
          <l>It would take a hundred or more</l>
          <l>For memories to fade.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>I wish Friday would last forever.</l>
          <l>I held her close to me.</l>
          <l>I couldn't bear to leave her there.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>Saturday, just twenty four hours.</l>
          <l>Oh, no, I'm going back home on Sunday.</l>
          <l>I'm so sad alone.</l>

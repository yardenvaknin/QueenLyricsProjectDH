          <l>Oh how wrong can you be?</l>
          <l>Oh to fall in love was my very first mistake</l>
          <l>How was I to know I was far too much in love to see?</l>
          <l>Oh jealousy look at me now</l>
          <l>Jealousy you got me somehow</l>
          <l>You gave me no warning</l>
          <l>Took me by surprise</l>
          <l>Jealousy you led me on</l>
          <l>You couldn't lose you couldn't fail</l>
          <l>You had suspicion on my trail</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>How how how all my jealousy</l>
          <l>I wasn't man enough to let you hurt my pride</l>
          <l>Now I'm only left with my own jealousy</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>Oh how strong can you be</l>
          <l>With matters of the heart?</l>
          <l>Life is much too short</l>
          <l>To while away with tears</l>
          <l>If only you could see just what you do to me</l>
          <l>Oh jealousy you tripped me up</l>
          <l>Jealousy you brought me down</l>
          <l>You bring me sorrow you cause me pain</l>
          <l>Jealousy when will you let go?</l>
          <l>Gotta hold of my possessive mind</l>
          <l>Turned me into a jealous kind</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>How how how all my jealousy</l>
          <l>I wasn't man enough to let you hurt my pride</l>
          <l>Now I'm only left with my own jealousy</l>
          <l>But now it matters not if I should live or die</l>
          <l>'Cause I'm only left with my own jealousy</l>

        <lg>
          <l>In the year of '39 assembled here the volunteers</l>
          <l>In the days when the lands were few</l>
          <l>Here the ship sailed out into the blue and sunny morn</l>
          <l>The sweetest sight ever seen.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>And the night followed day</l>
          <l>And the story tellers say</l>
          <l>That the score brave souls inside</l>
          <l>For many a lonely day sailed across the milky seas</l>
          <l>Never looked back, never feared, never cried.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>Don't you hear my call though you're many years away</l>
          <l>Don't you hear me calling you</l>
          <l>Write your letters in the sand</l>
          <l>For the day I take your hand</l>
          <l>In the land that our grandchildren knew.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>In the year of '39 came a ship in from the blue</l>
          <l>The volunteers came home that day</l>
          <l>And they bring good news of a world so newly born</l>
          <l>Though their hearts so heavily weigh</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>For the earth is old and grey, little darling wellaway</l>
          <l>But my love this cannot be</l>
          <l>For so many years have gone though I'm older but a year</l>
          <l>Your mother's eyes from your eyes cry to me.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>Don't you hear my call though you're many years away</l>
          <l>Don't you hear me calling you</l>
          <l>Write your letters in the sand</l>
          <l>For the day I take your hand</l>
          <l>In the land that our grandchildren knew.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>Don't you hear my call though you're many years away</l>
          <l>Don't you hear me calling you</l>
          <l>All your letters in the sand cannot heal me like your hand</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>For my life</l>
          <l>Still ahead</l>
          <l>Pity me.</l>

        <lg>
          <l>&quot;Take good care of what you've got,&quot;</l>
          <l>My father said to me.</l>
          <l>As he puffed his pipe and Baby B.</l>
          <l>He dandled on his knee,</l>
          <l>&quot;Don't fool with fools who'll turn away.</l>
          <l>Keep all good company.&quot;</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>Take care of those you call your own</l>
          <l>And keep good company</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>Soon I grew and happy too</l>
          <l>My very good friends and me</l>
          <l>We'd play all day with Sally J.</l>
          <l>The girl from number four</l>
          <l>And very soon I begged her, &quot;Won't you keep me company?&quot;</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>Come marry me for evermore</l>
          <l>We'll be good company</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>Now marriage is an institution. Sure</l>
          <l>My wife and I, our needs and nothing more</l>
          <l>All my friends by a year</l>
          <l>By and by disappeared</l>
          <l>But we're safe enough behind our door.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>I flourished in my humble trade</l>
          <l>My reputation grew</l>
          <l>The work devoured my waking hours</l>
          <l>But when my time was through</l>
          <l>Reward of all my efforts: my own limited company</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>I hardly noticed Sally as we parted company</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>All through the years</l>
          <l>In the end it appears</l>
          <l>There was never really anyone but me</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>Now I'm old, I puff my pipe</l>
          <l>But no one's there to see</l>
          <l>I ponder on the lesson of my life's insanity</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>Take care of those you call your own</l>
          <l>And keep good company</l>
        </lg>

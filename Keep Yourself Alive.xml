        I was told a million times
        Of all the troubles in my way
        Mind you grow a little wiser
        Little better every day  
        </p>            

        <p xml:id="stanza2">
          But if I crossed a million rivers
          And I rode a million miles
          Then I'd still be where I started
          Bread and butter for a smile  
        </p> 

         <p xml:id="stanza3"> 
            Well I sold a million mirrors
            In a shop in Alley Way
            But I never saw my face
            In any window any day

            Now they say your folks are telling you
            Be a super star
            But I tell you just be satisfied
            Stay right where you are

            Well I've loved a million women
            In a belladonnic haze
            And I ate a million dinners
            Brought to me on silver trays

            Give me everything I need
            To feed my body and my soul
            Well I'll grow a little bigger
            Maybe that can be my goal

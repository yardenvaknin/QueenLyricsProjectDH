# Digital Humanities Project

### Queen Lyrics Project create XML file 

This is a project in Digital Humanities Course at Ben Gurion University with PhD, Yael Nezer.

We created Extensible Markup Language (XML) document that describes the structure and metadata for each song of Queen.
We used Oxygen software as a tool to verify the correctness of  the XML's files.

We also uploaded each XML file to github.

We added to each song TEI with the metadata.
Our goal was to convert unstructured data to semi-structured data , as we learned in the course.

We tagged the data in the XML file and considered the content, structure and form of the songs.

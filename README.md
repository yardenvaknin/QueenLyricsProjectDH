# Digital Humanities Project

### Queen Lyrics Project create XML file 

This website was created as a project in Digital Humanities Course at Ben Gurion University with Dr. Yael Nezer
Link to Course Website: https://www.cs.bgu.ac.il/~dhcs202/Main

We created Extensible Markup Language (XML) document that describes the structure and metadata for each song of Queen with automatic code that collects the data from lyrics website using Beautiful soup library in Python.

We used Oxygen software as a tool to verify the correctness of  the XML's files.

We added to each song TEI with the metadata.
We created automatically HTML files and added to them the XML's TEI and style.

Our goal was to convert unstructured data to semi-structured data , as we learned in the course.

We tagged the data in the XML file and considered the content, structure and form of the songs.

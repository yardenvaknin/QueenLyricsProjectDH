        <lg>
          <l>I make it half past six you come at seven</l>
          <l>Always trying to keep me, hanging round</l>
          <l>You little spoilt thing, girl you kept me waiting</l>
          <l>Never contemplating my point of view</l>
          <l>This comes as no surprise</l>
          <l>I'm a fool, for I believed your lies</l>
          <l>But now I've seen through your disguise</l>
          <l>Who needs, well I don't need, who needs you?</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>Oh I believed you</l>
          <l>Went on my knees to you</l>
          <l>How I trusted you</l>
          <l>But you turned me down</l>
          <l>But it's dog eat dog in this rat race</l>
          <l>And it leaves you bleeding lying flat on your face</l>
          <l>Reaching out, reaching out for a helping hand</l>
          <l>Where is that helping hand?</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>How I was pushed around</l>
          <l>&quot;Don't let it get you down&quot;</l>
          <l>You walked all over me</l>
          <l>&quot;But don't you ever give in&quot;</l>
          <l>Taking one step forward, slipping two steps back</l>
          <l>There's an empty feeling that you can't forget</l>
          <l>Reaching out, reaching out for a helping hand</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>When I met you, you were always charming</l>
          <l>Couldn't sleep at night 'till you were mine</l>
          <l>You were oh so so sophisticated</l>
          <l>Never interested in what I'd say</l>
          <l>I had to swallow my pride</l>
          <l>So naive, you took me for a ride</l>
          <l>But now I'm the one to decide</l>
          <l>Who needs, well I don't need, who needs you?</l>

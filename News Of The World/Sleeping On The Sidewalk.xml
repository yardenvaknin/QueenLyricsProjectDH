        <lg>
          <l>I was nothin' but a city boy</l>
          <l>My trumpet was my only toy</l>
          <l>I've been blowin' my horn</l>
          <l>Since I knew I was born</l>
          <l>But there ain't nobody wants to know</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>I've been</l>
          <l>Sleepin' on the sidewalk</l>
          <l>Rollin' down the road</l>
          <l>I may get hungry</l>
          <l>But I sure don't want to go home</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>So round the corner comes a limousine</l>
          <l>And the biggest grin I've ever seen</l>
          <l>Hey sonny won't you sign</l>
          <l>Right along the dotted line</l>
          <l>What you sayin' Are you playin'</l>
          <l>Sure you don't mean me?</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>Sleepin' on the sidewalk</l>
          <l>Rollin' down the road</l>
          <l>I may get hungry</l>
          <l>But I sure don't wanna go home</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>(I'll tell you what happened. . .)</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>They took me to a room without a table</l>
          <l>They said &quot;blow your trumpet into here&quot;</l>
          <l>I played around as well as I was able</l>
          <l>And soon we had the record of the year</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>I was a legend all through the land</l>
          <l>I was blowin' to a million fans</l>
          <l>Nothin' was a-missin'</l>
          <l>All the people want to listen</l>
          <l>You'd have thought I was a happy man</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>And I was</l>
          <l>Sleepin' like a princess</l>
          <l>Never touched the road</l>
          <l>I don't get hungry</l>
          <l>And I sure don't want to go home</l>
          <l>(have to have some fun. . .)</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>Now they tell me that I ain't so fashionable</l>
          <l>And that I owe the man a million bucks a year</l>
          <l>So I told 'em where to stick the fancy label</l>
          <l>It's just me and the road from here</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>I'm back to playin' and layin'</l>
          <l>I'm back on the game</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>I'm sleepin' on the sidewalk</l>
          <l>Rollin' down the road</l>
          <l>I sure get hungry and I</l>
          <l>Sure do wanna go home</l>
          <l>(Yeah)</l>

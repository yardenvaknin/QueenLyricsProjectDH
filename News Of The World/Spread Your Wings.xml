          <l>Sammy was low</l>
          <l>Just watching the show</l>
          <l>Over and over again</l>
          <l>Knew it was time</l>
          <l>He'd made up his mind</l>
          <l>To leave his dead life behind</l>
          <l>His boss said to him</l>
          <l>&quot;Boy you'd better begin</l>
          <l>To get those crazy notions right out of your head</l>
          <l>Sammy who do you think that you are?</l>
          <l>You should've been sweeping up the Emerald Bar&quot;</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>Spread your wings and fly away</l>
          <l>Fly away, far away</l>
          <l>Spread your little wings and fly away</l>
          <l>Fly away, far away</l>
          <l>Pull yourself together</l>
          <l>'Cause you know you should do better</l>
          <l>That's because you're a free man</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>He spends his evenings alone in his hotel room</l>
          <l>Keeping his thoughts to himself, he'd be leaving soon</l>
          <l>Wishing he was miles and miles away</l>
          <l>Nothing in this world, nothing would make him stay</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>Since he was small</l>
          <l>Had no luck at all</l>
          <l>Nothing came easy to him</l>
          <l>Now it was time</l>
          <l>He'd made up his mind</l>
          <l>&quot;This could be my last chance&quot;</l>
          <l>His boss said to him, &quot;Now listen boy!</l>
          <l>You're always dreaming</l>
          <l>You've got no real ambition, you won't get very far</l>
          <l>Sammy boy, don't you know who you are?</l>
          <l>Why can't you be happy at the Emerald Bar?&quot;</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>So honey</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>Spread your wings and fly away</l>
          <l>Fly away, far away</l>
          <l>Spread your little wings and fly away</l>
          <l>Fly away, far away</l>
          <l>Pull yourself together</l>
          <l>'Cause you know you should do better</l>
          <l>That's because you're a free man</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>Come on, honey</l>
          <l>Fly with me</l>

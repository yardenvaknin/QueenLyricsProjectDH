        <lg>
          <l>I've paid my dues</l>
          <l>Time after time.</l>
          <l>I've done my sentence</l>
          <l>But committed no crime.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>And bad mistakesâ€’</l>
          <l>I've made a few.</l>
          <l>I've had my share of sand kicked in my face</l>
          <l>But I've come through.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>And I need to go on and on, and on, and on.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>We are the champions, my friends.</l>
          <l>And we'll keep on fighting 'til the end.</l>
          <l>We are the champions.</l>
          <l>We are the champions.</l>
          <l>No time for losers</l>
          <l>'Cause we are the champions of the world.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>I've taken my bows,</l>
          <l>And my curtain calls.</l>
          <l>You brought me fame and fortune, and everything that goes with it.</l>
          <l>I thank you all.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>But it's been no bed of roses,</l>
          <l>No pleasure cruise.</l>
          <l>I consider it a challenge before the whole human race,</l>
          <l>And I ain't gonna lose.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>And I need just go on and on, and on, and on.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>We are the champions, my friends.</l>
          <l>And we'll keep on fighting 'til the end.</l>
          <l>We are the champions.</l>
          <l>We are the champions.</l>
          <l>No time for losers</l>
          <l>'Cause we are the champions of the world.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>We are the champions, my friends,</l>
          <l>And we'll keep on fighting 'til the end.</l>
          <l>We are the champions.</l>
          <l>We are the champions.</l>
          <l>No time for losers</l>
          <l>'Cause we are the champions.</l>

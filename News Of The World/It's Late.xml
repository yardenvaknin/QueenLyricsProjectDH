          <l>You say you love me</l>
          <l>And I hardly know your name</l>
          <l>And if I say I love you in the candle light</l>
          <l>There's no one but myself to blame</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>But there's something inside</l>
          <l>That's turning my mind away</l>
          <l>Oh, how I could love you</l>
          <l>If I could let you stay</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>It's late when I'm bleeding deep inside</l>
          <l>It's late. Ooh, is it just my sickly pride?</l>
          <l>Too late. Even now the feeling seems to steal away</l>
          <l>So late. Though I'm crying I can't help but hear you say</l>
          <l>It's late, it's late, it's late, but not too late</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>The way you love me</l>
          <l>Is the sweetest love around</l>
          <l>But after all this time</l>
          <l>The more I'm trying</l>
          <l>The more I seem to let you down</l>
          <l>Yes, baby</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>Now you tell me you're leaving</l>
          <l>And I just can't believe it's true</l>
          <l>Oh, you know that I can love you</l>
          <l>Though I know I can't be true</l>
          <l>Oh, you made me love you</l>
          <l>Don't tell me that we're through</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>It's late, but it's driving me so mad</l>
          <l>It's late. Yes, I know but don't try to tell me</l>
          <l>That it's too late. Save our love you can't turn out the lights</l>
          <l>So late. I've been wrong but I'll learn to be right</l>
          <l>It's late, it's late, it's late, but not too late</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>I've been so long</l>
          <l>You've been so long</l>
          <l>We've been so long tryna work it out</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>I ain't got long</l>
          <l>You ain't got long</l>
          <l>We gotta know what this life is all about</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>Tell me</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>Tryna work it out</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>Ooh, too late, yeah</l>
          <l>Too late, much too late</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>You're staring at me</l>
          <l>With suspicion in your eye</l>
          <l>You say what game are you playing?</l>
          <l>What's this that you're saying?</l>
          <l>I know that I can't reply</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>If I take you tonight</l>
          <l>Is it making my life a lie?</l>
          <l>Oh, you make me wonder</l>
          <l>Did I live my life right?</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>It's late, but it's time to set me free</l>
          <l>It's late. Ooh, yes, I know but there's no way it has to be</l>
          <l>Too late. So, let the fire take our bodies this night</l>
          <l>So late. Let the waters take our guilt in the tide</l>
          <l>It's late, it's late, it's late, it's late, it's late, it's late, it's late</l>
          <l>It's all too late</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>Whoa, whoa</l>
          <l>It's too late, c'mon</l>
          <l>Late too late, oh, yeah</l>

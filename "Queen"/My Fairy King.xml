      <head>My Fairy King</head>
      <p>
        <l>In the land where horses born with eagle wings</l>
        <l>And honey bees have lost their stings</l>
        <l>There's singing forever</l>
        <l>Lion's den with fallow deer</l>
        <l>And rivers made from wine so clear</l>
        <l>Flow on and on forever</l>
        <l>Dragons fly like sparrows thru' the air</l>
        <l>And baby lambs where Samson dares</l>
        <l>To go on on on on on on</l>
      </p>
      <p>
        <l>[First voice] [Second Voice]</l>
        <l>My fairy king can see things | He rules the air and turns the tides</l>
        <l>That are not there for you and me | Ohh yeah he guides the winds</l>
      </p>
      <p>
        <l>My fairy king can do right and nothing wrong</l>
        <l>Then came man to savage in the night</l>
        <l>To run like thieves and to kill like knives</l>
        <l>To take away the power from the magic hand</l>
        <l>To bring about the ruin to the promised land</l>
      </p>
      <p>
        <l>They turn the milk into sour</l>
        <l>Like the blue in the blood of my veins</l>
        <l>Why can't you see it</l>
        <l>Fire burnin' in hell with the cry of screaming pain</l>
        <l>Son of heaven set me free and let me go</l>
        <l>Sea turn dry no salt from sand</l>
        <l>Seasons fly no helping hand</l>
        <l>Teeth don't shine like pearls for the poor man's eyes</l>
      </p>
      <p>
        <l>Someone someone has drained the colour from my wings</l>
        <l>Broken my fairy circle ring</l>
        <l>And shamed the king in all his pride</l>
        <l>Changed the winds and wronged the tides</l>
        <l>Mother mercury (mercury)</l>
        <l>Look what they've done to me</l>
        <l>I cannot run I cannot hide</l>

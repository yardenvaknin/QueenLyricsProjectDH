      <head>Jesus</head>
      <p>
        <l>And then I saw Him in the crowd</l>
        <l>A lot of people had gathered round Him</l>
        <l>The beggers shouted and the lepers called Him</l>
        <l>The old man said nothing</l>
        <l>He just stared about Him</l>
        <l>All going down to see the Lord Jesus</l>
        <l>All going down to see the Lord Jesus</l>
        <l>All going down</l>
      </p>
      <p>
        <l>Then came a man before His feet he fell</l>
        <l>Unclean said the leper and rang his bell</l>
        <l>Felt the palm of a hand touch his head</l>
        <l>Go now go now you're a new man instead</l>
        <l>All going down to see the Lord Jesus</l>
        <l>All going down to see the Lord Jesus</l>
        <l>All going down</l>
      </p>
      <p>
        <l>It all began with the three wise men</l>
        <l>Followed a star took them to Bethelehem</l>
        <l>And made it heard throughout the land</l>
        <l>Born was the leader of man</l>
        <l>All going down to see the Lord Jesus</l>
        <l>All going down to see the Lord Jesus</l>
        <l>All going down</l>
      </p>
      <p>
        <l>It all began with the three wise men</l>
        <l>Followed a star took them to Bethelehem</l>
        <l>And made it heard throughout the land</l>
        <l>Born was the leader of man</l>
        <l>All going down to see the Lord Jesus</l>
        <l>All going down to see the Lord Jesus</l>
        <l>All going down</l>
